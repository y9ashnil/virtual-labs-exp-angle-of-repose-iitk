Experiment 3: Angle of repose and effect of lubricants/ glidants on flow property of powder.

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based on the determining the values angle of repose for some pharmaceutical powder samples and the effect of glidant when added in different concentration. Student proceeds with the simulator to understands the concept of flowability by experimentation. The values of angle of repose are recorded by using the measurement of height and radius of the pile which forms on the passage of powder through funnel adjusted on a specific height. The powder can be added to the funnel by 'Add powder' tab on the simulator. The values of angle of repose along with the glidant can be observed in the autogenerated observation table by the simulator. The final objective is to find out the values of angle of repose individually and also with the glidant at two different concentrations to observe the flowability of sample powder. By performing this experiment the student will be able to understands the concept of flowability and also to apply and analyse these concepts during several pharmaceutical formulation development processings.

### 2. Story:

Powdres are generally considered to be composed of solid particles of the same or different chemical compositions having diameters less than 1000 microns. Pharmaceutically, the largest use of powders is to produce tablets and capsules, in addition to mixing and compression properties, the flowability of a powder is of critical importance in production.Success or failure in many pharmaceutical operations can be directly linked to the flow properties of the powder being processed. Flowability is critically important when assessing how material moves around the plant. Industry needs the ability to develop formulations withtailored flowability, and first step is identifying suitable techniques for powder characterization.<Br>
Depending upon the attractive forces between the powder particles, powders may be free flowing or cohesive (sticky). Flow properties of a powder depend upon its particle size, particle size distribution, particle shape, powder density, surface texture, moisture content and electrostatic attractive forces between particles. Powder flow is important in manufacturing of tablets, filling of capsules, bottles, vials, and in powder mixing. If the granules do not flow properly from hopper to die cavity, it will cause weight variation problems in manufacturing of tablets.<Br>
When a powder is allowed to flow onto a flat surface, a conical heap is formed. The particles will slip and roll over each other, until the gravitational force is balanced by the cohesive forces between the particles. The angle formed by the heap with the horizontal surface is known as angle of repose. The lesser the angle of repose the better is the flow property of the powder. From the radius and the height of the heap, angle of repose can be determined. The tangent of angle of repose is a measure of the frictional forces between the flowing powder particles.Angle of repose of a powder can be found out by open end cylinder or fixed funnel method.

Formative Assessment question as explained in Round 1 <Br>
 
**Difficulty Level: Understand**<Br>

A. Excellent<Br>
B. Good<Br>
C. Moderate<Br>
D. Poor <Br>
 
##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Pitfall is designed to clear misconceptions or incorrect knowledge. It helps to develop a deep understanding of the concept.<Br>
 
Pitfall Stage : Before the selection of the sample powder the graph paper has to be added in the assembly so that the heap of powder may form upon that only in order to detremine the radius of the heap. if not then it leads to the error.

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Time taken by student to complete the experiment:
The student correctly answered: -----
There are only 1 question to nalayze the understanding of the student. Small tasks are incorported in the simulator like addition of the graph paper etc. to provide the environment of the experiment and also to help in building the understanding of the student. The approximate time required to understand the procedure and to perform the experiment would take about 15 min. To generate data will take another 10 minutes. Answering the assessment questions will take about 5 min. Thus the total time required to perform the experiment will be around 30 minutes.
