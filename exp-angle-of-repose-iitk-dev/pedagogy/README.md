#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce Theoretical Concepts, Experimentations and Data analysis
The user re-register their previously learnt theoreritical concepts by seeing it visually and by their working along with the experiment. They also perform the formula based experimentation to acquire knowledge from it and finally analyzing results with standard value.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment
    
<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
The student will be able to assemble some part of the assembly and can set several variables like the selection of powder sample or the concentration of the glidant. By setting these variables on their own student get the concepts and the purpose of each component. Based on the readings they will get the value of angle of repose which can be further utilized  to analyze the flow property of pharmaceutical powders.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to describe the concepts of flow properties of powders | On the simulator screen, student selects graph paper to place it as per the experimental setup. | Assemble the experimental setup in order to perform the experiment
2.| User will be able to calculate the angle of repose of pharmaceutical powders| On the simulator screen, student get the readings of radius and height of pile which is further putted into predefined formula to calculate the angle of repose of powder| Calculate the value of angle of repose of powder
3.| User will be able to calculate the angle of repose of pharmaceutical powders in the presence of glidant.| On the simulator screen, student selects the concentration of the glidant and get the readings of radius and height of pile in observation table in order to achieve angle of repose of powder | Calculate the value of angle of repose of powder along with glidant
4.| User will be able to apply the concepts of angle of repose to identify the flowability of pharmaceutical powders.| On the simulator screen, a standard table of angle of repose will appear, user have to identify the flow ability of selected powder by comparing their result with standard table | Compare result of selected powder with standard table to know the flowability of powder
5.| User will be able to examine the flow ability of pharmaceutical powders in presence and absence of glidant.| On the basis of the standard table of angle of repose on simulators's screen user can analyse the flowability of powder before and after adiition of glidant| On the basis of the calculated result analyse the flowability of your powder sample <br> A. Excellent <br> B. Good <br> C. Moderate <br> D. Poor <br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student click on the Simulation tab | Simulator screen of the experiment will open up | To open the screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Student will select the add graph paper button | On simulator's screen graph paper will be added to the assembly  | To recall the previously learned concept
3.| Student will select the sample powder from the variables section of simulator | Simulator will showcase the options for the selection of powder sample | To provide an environment and to understand the basic concepts for the experimentation .
4.| Student will click on the 'add powder' button | On simulator's screen the powder will added up into the assembly and a small heap of powder will be observed | To record the readings.
5.| Student will click on the 'show graph paper' button | On simulator's screen the top view of graph paper will be observed in order to find out the radius of the pile and its value will be observed in the observation table| To record the readings.
6.| Student will click on the 'show graph paper' button | On simulator's screen the top view of graph paper will be observed in order to find out the radius of the pile and its value will be observed in the observation table| To record the readings.
