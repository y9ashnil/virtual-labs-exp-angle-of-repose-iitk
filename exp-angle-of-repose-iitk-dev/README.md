<b> Experiment|     <b>3. Angle of repose determination and effect of glidants/ lubricants on flow property of powders.
<h5> About the Lab (Objective) :</h5>The Practical course of this lab is completely focused on perceiving the physicochemical phenomenon and characteristics which effects the formulation of pharmaceutical dosage forms and systems.
<h5> About the Experiment:</h5>
Flow property of powders is the important characteristic to be considered for the formulation of several dosage forms like tablets etc , for filling of capsules, bottles and vials and also in dry powder mixing. Angle of repose determination is one of the most reliable and convenient method by which flowability can be determined. By the addition of several glidants or lubricant the flowability can be improved hence, angle of repose can also be used to optimize the concentration of these additives.
